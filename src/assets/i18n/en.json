I've gained hands-on experience with Vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and Django. What excites me about coding is the combination of logic, creativity, and real-world impact.<br><br>I'm eager to learn, open to new technologies, and enjoy working in teamsâ€”whether through pair programming, code reviews, or remote collaboration tools. I approach problems with structure, creativity, and persistence. Thanks to my organizational skills, empathetic communication, and sense of responsibility, I integrate quickly into teams and reliably contribute to project success.",
